The Environmental Protection Agency created an Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool called EJScreen that tracks both demographic and environmental factors that impact environmental health. Having socioeconomic information linked with environmental indexes allows researchers to draw connections between the two to determine how there is inequity in environmental health. The dataset we chose tracks these factors on a national level, including education level, traffic proximity, ozone, unemployment rate, and low-income. We can use the EJScreen data to find correlation between these variables to identify potential risks in environmental health for underprivileged demographics.

Our motivation behind choosing this dataset is to see if socioeconomic factors such as education level or unemployment rate have a correlation with environmental factors that pose a risk to an individualâ€™s physical and mental well-being. Additionally, we can draw comparisons across geographic borders by filtering by states. For example, less densely populated states might have lower levels of environmental health disparities as compared to those in more densely populated states. Furthermore, we can isolate states and look at data in a specific state if we see something of interest during our initial analysis.
